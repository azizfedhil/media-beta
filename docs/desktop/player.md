# Player (Batches 4.1 and 4.2)

- `player/PlayerEngine.kt`: the interface (state flows, load, seek, tracks, `setAspectMode`, `setHdrToneMapping`).
- `desktopMain/.../mpv/MpvPlayerEngine.kt`: libmpv over JNA. Created with `vo=libmpv`, so there is no mpv window; frames come through the render API.
- `desktopMain/.../mpv/MpvVideoRenderer.kt`: mpv software renderer (`api_type=sw`, format `bgr0`). mpv writes straight into a Skia `Bitmap`'s pixels (rows padded to 16 px); Skia makes one immutable `Image` per frame. Runs on its own thread, publishes the latest frame as a `StateFlow`. The render context is freed before the mpv handle.
- `VideoSurface` (expect/actual): a Canvas that draws the latest frame. Performance mode caps the render size at 1080p (the picture is scaled up when drawn); otherwise the cap is 4K.
- Aspect: Fit (keepaspect), Fill (`panscan=1`), Stretch (`keepaspect=no`).
- HDR: software rendering has no GPU tone mapper, so PQ/HLG video gets an ffmpeg `zscale` + `tonemap=hable` filter (`@pearhdr`) while it plays. Needs an ffmpeg with libzimg (the shinchiro Windows build has it).
- Hardware decoding uses the copy variant (`auto-copy-safe`) because the software path can't take GPU surfaces.
- Fullscreen: `WindowControl.isFullscreen` (Main.kt sets `WindowPlacement`). The shell hides the sidebar / tab bar while a player is on top.
